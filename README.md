# ChatGPT-Clone

The .env file was removed, and along with it, the OpenAiAPI key using gitignore. Go to chatGPT API keys using your account to acquire an API key. Place it in a 
.env file in the server directory of this project using the following variable:

OPENAI_API_KEY="[REPLACE WITH API KEY HERE - INCLUDING BRACKETS]"

That's it. It should now work once you run the client and server in seperate terminal instances.
